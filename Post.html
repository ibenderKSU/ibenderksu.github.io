<p style="color: #e4f0f0">Here lies the album cover to "Beerbongs and Bentleys". This album is important to me because it layed the foundations to the first real relationship I have had in life.</p>
<p style="color: #e4f0f0">Released in 2018, this album connected me to my first real girlfriend. We were on a bus heading to a soccer game and we connected with each other by listening to the album on repeat the whole ride.</p>
<p style="color: #e4f0f0"><br><br>Though the relationship did not workout, I still am thankful for the time I had with that girl. So i acredit this album to that important part of my life. When the relationship was over this songs feeling was intensified.</p>
